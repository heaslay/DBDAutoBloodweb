2. **Prepare 1.15 million Bloodpoints**:

7. **Update Check**:
   - After the automation process is complete, the tool will check for any available updates and prompt you if a new version is available.

## Recommended Bloodpoints
For a smooth prestige process, it is recommended to have **at least 1.15 million Bloodpoints** available. This ensures that the tool can purchase all nodes on the Bloodweb without running out of Bloodpoints.

## Known Issues
