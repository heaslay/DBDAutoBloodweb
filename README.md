# Dead By Daylight Auto Prestige Tool

The **Dead By Daylight Auto Prestige Tool** automates the prestige process in Dead By Daylight, saving you time by automatically purchasing Bloodweb nodes and searching for specific offerings.

## Features
- **Automatic Prestige Process**: Automatically purchases nodes on the Bloodweb without user input.
- **Offering Priority**: Prioritise specific offerings:
  - Bloody Party Streamers (highest priority)
  - Escape! Cake
  - Survivor Pudding
- **Update Notifications**: Notifies you when a new version of the tool is available and provides a link to download the latest release.

## How to Use
1. **Download the latest release**:
   - [Download dbd_auto_prestige.exe](https://github.com/heaslay/DBDAutoBloodweb/releases/download/v1.0.1/dbd_auto_prestige.exe)
2. **Run the executable**:
   - Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file.
3. **Switch to Dead By Daylight**:
   - The script includes a 5-second delay before it starts. Make sure to switch to the Dead By Daylight application during this time.
4. **Automation starts**:
   - The tool will begin purchasing Bloodweb nodes and searching for offerings automatically.
5. **Update Check**:
   - After the automation process is complete, the tool will check for any available updates and prompt you if a new version is available.

## Recommended Bloodpoints
For a smooth prestige process, it is recommended to have **at least 1.15 million Bloodpoints** available. This ensures that the tool can purchase all nodes on the Bloodweb without running out of Bloodpoints.

## Known Issues
- **Bloodweb Load Time**: Some systems may experience slow loading times for the Bloodweb. This tool provides extra time between actions, but if you experience issues, ensure your game and system are running smoothly.

## Future Plans
- Add **native Linux support**.
- Improve performance for slower systems.
